                        the Swiss Re Building (colloquially referred to as the Gherkin), is a skyscraper
                        in London's main financial district, the City of London, completed in December 2003
                        and opened at the end of May 2004. With 40 floors, the tower is 180 metres (591
                        ft) tall, and stands on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, which was
                        severely damaged on 10 April 1992 by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional
                        IRA.

                        The building is on the former site of the Baltic Exchange building, the headquarters
                        of a global marketplace for ship sales and shipping information. On 10 April 1992
                        the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Exchange, severely damaging the
                        historic Exchange building and neighbouring structures. The UK government's statutory
                        adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London governing
                        body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore
                        the building's old façade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture
                        of the ship trading company.
