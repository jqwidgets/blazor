    Avatar is a 2009 American[6][7] epic science fiction film written and directed by
    James Cameron, and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle
    Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set
    in the mid-22nd century, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium
    on Pandora , a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system.
    The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local
    tribe of Na'vi—a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers
    to the genetically engineered Na'vi-human hybrid bodies used by a team of researchers
    to interact with the natives of Pandora.

    from an assassin's bullet. Later, with the help of a persistent newspaper reporter
    named Kate Crawford (played by Angie Harmon), he uncovers a vast conspiracy behind
    what initially appeared to be a lone gunman. James Woods, Burt Reynolds, and Anne
    Archer co–star in this film that was originally set to be shown in cinemas by MGM

    The project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures,
    during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel
    was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after three years
    of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation
    of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought
    to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days, and
    completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon

    Meanwhile, in a rail yard within the northern town of Fuller, two AWVR hostlers,
    Dewey (Ethan Suplee) and Gilleece (T.J. Miller), are ordered by Fuller operations
    dispatcher Bunny (Kevin Chapman) to move a freight train led by locomotive #777
    (nicknamed "Triple Seven") off its current track to clear the track for an excursion
    train carrying schoolchildren. Dewey attempts to take shortcuts, instructing Gilleece
    to leave the hoses for the air brakes disconnected for the short trip. Dewey later
    leaves the moving cab to throw a misaligned rail switch along the train's path,
    but is unable to climb back on, as the train's throttle jumps from idle, to full
    power. He is forced to report the train as a "coaster" to Fuller yardmaster Connie
    Hooper (Rosario Dawson)...
