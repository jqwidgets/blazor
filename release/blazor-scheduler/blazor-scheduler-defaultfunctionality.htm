            This is an example of Blazor Scheduler. The Scheduler component for Blazor is very powerful and enables you to set appointments by hour and date.  It supports day, week and month timelines. There is an easily accessible calendar which you can use in order to set the appointments. The Agenda view is very convenient to see all the events in a given day. The events can be customized and can have different colors.  All the appointment properties can be changed through the API of the scheduler. You can also enable recurring appointments. One extra feature is that you can see the time conveniently in the different time zones. The rows height can be configured and the ruler can be hidden. You can also set to see the week numbers on the left. Creating new appointments can be done with a context menu. The width of the columns can be customized.
