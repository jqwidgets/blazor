        This is an example of Blazor Treegrid. The treegrid component is a mixture between a grid and a tree component. The first elements of the grid are grouped by the first column which opens like the parent node of a tree. The tree grid component is very
        useful when you have to display properties. It supports paging and data binding to XML, JSON, CSV and Tab delimited data. It also supports sorting, filtering and paging and aggregates. Data can be exported to Excel, XML, CSV, TSV, JSON, PDF and
        HTML. The tree grid component enable data printing and localization. You can also have conditional formatting and conditional rendering.
