            This is an example of Blazor Chart padding and spacing of columns series. In order to prevent adjacent columns overlap you have to set the skipOverlappingPoints setting to true. You can see how to set the columns and the series gap percent. If you want the columns in the two series groups to overlap you have to set the columnSeriesOverlap setting to true. You can also see how to set the columns spacing and the minimum and maximum column width.
